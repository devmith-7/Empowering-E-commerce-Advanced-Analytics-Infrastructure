# Empowering-E-commerce-Advanced-Analytics-Infrastructure

SoftCart, an e-commerce company, employs a hybrid data architecture, leveraging both on-premises and cloud environments to optimize its data management and analytics capabilities.

# Tools and Technologies:

OLTP Database: MySQL is used for managing online transaction processing.
NoSQL Database: MongoDB, catering to the storage of catalog data for products.
Production Data Warehouse: IBM DB2 on Cloud, serving as the primary repository for operational data.
Staging Data Warehouse: PostgreSQL, utilized for initial data staging and processing.
Big Data Platform: Hadoop cluster, supporting large-scale data storage and processing.
Big Data Analytics: Apache Spark, employed for advanced data analytics on the Hadoop platform.
Business Intelligence Dashboard: IBM Cognos Analytics, used for creating insightful operational dashboards.
Data Pipelines: Managed and automated by Apache Airflow, facilitating efficient data movement across systems.
Process Overview:

SoftCart's online platform, accessible via various devices like laptops, mobiles, and tablets, is powered by robust database management systems. Product catalog data is stored in MongoDB, ensuring flexible data handling, while MySQL manages all transactional aspects, such as inventory and sales records. The seamless integration of these databases underpins the functionality of SoftCart's web server.

Data from these sources is periodically extracted and transferred to a staging data warehouse running PostgreSQL. This step acts as a precursor to further data refinement and analysis. The refined data is then moved to the production data warehouse hosted on IBM DB2 in the cloud. This cloud-based warehouse forms the backbone of SoftCart's data analytics and operational reporting.

The IBM Cognos Analytics tool is pivotal in creating operational dashboards, providing the BI team with powerful visualization capabilities directly connected to the cloud data warehouse.

For more comprehensive data analytics, SoftCart capitalizes on its Hadoop cluster. Here, large volumes of data collected from various sources are stored and processed. Apache Spark, renowned for its speed and analytics prowess, is the tool of choice for analyzing data within this big data ecosystem.

The orchestration of data movement across these diverse platforms, from OLTP and NoSQL databases to the data warehouses, is adeptly managed through ETL pipelines. These pipelines, running on Apache Airflow, ensure not only the smooth flow of data but also its integrity and timeliness, thereby enabling SoftCart to maintain a competitive edge in data-driven decision-making.
